Dream honeymoon in Bali,2024-03-15,5,"GuavaTrips planned our perfect honeymoon in Bali. Every detail was handled - from the overwater villa booking to private sunset dinners. Their local guide recommendations were spot-on, and the 24/7 support gave us peace of mind. Worth every penny!"
Disappointed with European tour,2024-02-20,2,"The 10-day European itinerary looked great on paper but fell apart in execution. Hotel in Rome was nothing like described, missed our train connection in Paris due to poor timing, and the 'skip-the-line' Vatican tickets didn't work. Poor coordination overall."
Incredible African Safari experience,2024-01-05,5,"GuavaTrips organized an unforgettable 2-week safari across Kenya and Tanzania. The wildlife photography opportunities were incredible, accommodations were luxurious yet authentic, and our guide was knowledgeable about conservation efforts. Life-changing experience!"
Overpriced for what we received,2024-03-01,3,"$8000 for a week in Japan seemed excessive when we could have planned similar trips for half the cost. Yes, they handled logistics, but the hotels were standard business level and many recommended restaurants were tourist traps. Expected more value."
Perfect family adventure in Costa Rica,2024-02-15,4,"Traveling with teens is challenging, but GuavaTrips nailed it. Zip-lining, volcano hikes, wildlife watching - activities kept everyone engaged. Only minor complaint was the first hotel's WiFi issues, but they quickly arranged an upgrade."
Seamless business trip to Singapore,2024-03-10,5,"Needed to combine business meetings with cultural experiences in Singapore. GuavaTrips created perfect itinerary balancing work and leisure. Luxury hotel near business district, efficient transport arrangements, and excellent restaurant recommendations."
Last-minute changes ruined vacation,2024-01-25,2,"Three days before departure for Greece, they changed our accommodation due to 'unforeseen circumstances.' New hotel was in a completely different area, ruining our planned activities. No compensation offered despite the significant inconvenience."
Hidden gems of Morocco discovered,2024-02-28,5,"GuavaTrips took us beyond typical tourist sites in Morocco. Stayed in traditional riads, experienced authentic hammams, and explored local markets with insider knowledge. Their cultural sensitivity training for travelers was valuable too."
Mediocre service for the price point,2024-03-05,3,"Service was fine but nothing extraordinary for premium pricing. Itinerary was generic, available accommodations we could have booked ourselves, and communication was slow. Expected more personalized attention at this price level."
Amazing solo female travel support,2024-01-15,4,"As a solo female traveler, safety was my priority. GuavaTrips provided detailed safety briefings, vetted accommodation in safe neighborhoods, and arranged reliable local contacts. Felt secure exploring Thailand independently."
Dietary restrictions ignored,2024-02-10,2,"Despite clearly communicating severe food allergies, restaurant recommendations were inappropriate and hotel didn't receive dietary information. Had to carry emergency medication throughout trip. Life-threatening oversight for serious allergies."

Poor customer service response,2024-01-20,1,"When our flight was cancelled, GuavaTrips was impossible to reach for 24 hours. Eventually had to rebook ourselves and fight for reimbursement later. For a premium service promising 24/7 support, this was unacceptable."
